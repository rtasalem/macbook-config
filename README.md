# MacBook Config
The blueprint I use for setting up a MacBook both as a personal device and/or work device.
## Contents
1. [MacBook Config Guide](https://github.com/rtasalem/macbook-config/blob/main/personal-setup/GUIDE.md): how I set up a MacBook as a personal device.
2. [Defra Local Development Config Guide](https://github.com/rtasalem/macbook-config/blob/main/defra-setup/GUIDE.md): notes I made while setting up any MacBook I use working as a software developer at Defra (this guide is specific to FFC/FCP a.k.a the Future Farming & Countryside/Farming & Countryside Programme).
To help with the process of setting up a MacBook for local development within Defra's FFC programme, I wrote some scripts [(dffc-mac-scripts)](https://github.com/rtasalem/dffc-mac-scripts) that will cover the majority of the set up guide (excluding NVM/Node.js/NPM, StandardJS, .NET SDK as I found these easier to install by following the instructions in the [ffc-development-guide](https://github.com/DEFRA/ffc-development-guide/blob/main/docs/local-development-setup/index.md)).
